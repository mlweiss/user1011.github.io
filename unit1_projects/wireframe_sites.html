	<p> Striking, bright photographs of art and valuable treasures for sale at auction greet the user in a large carousel that takes up 80% of the page. The carousel automatically scrolls through the photographs prompting the user to click on one of the diverse auctions. Above and below the carousel there are horizontal menus that pop up to larger menus when hovered over by the cursor. This is a very efficient and pleasing design solution that allows for an emphasis on the central aspect of Christies: the beautiful items that are on sale. </p>

	<p> A smaller carousel greets the user's eye. Scrolling down brings a diverse aray of images of paintings, furniture, and other mediums of art. Unlike Christies, where the auctions for much more expensive pieces of artwork will be taking place mostly off site, the goal for Paddle8 is to show as many pieces as possible that might interest the visitor. Entreaties to become a member and learn how the site works follow naturally in the flow after the main carousel. The bright photo focused design allows the user to explore new artworks and rapidly access the bidding page when he/she finds something to bid on. </p>

	<p> The site uses a more subtle approach to displaying a number of products. There is very little text on the page outside of the menus: the prices and descriptions are hidden until the mouse hovers over them. Each piece is given equal weight in terms of visual space. Overall the site has a minimalist style avoiding boxes and maximizing white space, giving more of a contrast to the pictures of the products. </p>
