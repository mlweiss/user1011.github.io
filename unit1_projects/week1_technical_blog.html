					<h1> Website Design </h1>
					<p> For this blog post I will be analyzing three websites that I feel display good design principles. What exactly those design principles are I will allow to be a fluid concept, however all three I believe accomplish their respective tasks through somewhat novel methods that I will try to identify and analyze. 
					</p>	
					<h1> <a href = "http://www.christies.com" title = "Christies" target = "_blank"> Christies </a> </h1>
					<p>
					This is a great example of a site that immediately catches the user's attention and rewards them for choosing to visit the site by presenting them with pleasant photographs of world-class artworks. A user visiting the site will likely be interested in what is selling currently at auctions and getting an idea of which artworks are currently popular on the market. The large central carousel is obviously the highlighted feature on the main page and presents the user with a few examples of current artworks for sale. The audience for the site is likely people casually interested in the art market. If interested they can click on this to get more information or use one of the menus above or below to go to a more sequential presentation of information about upcoming or current auctions. For journalists and people working in the art market these links will be the main draw to the site.
					</p>
					<p> Streamlined, clear, bright, elegant, and efficient in its use of space, the Christies website has a visually pleasing presentation that gets the user excited about the artworks being presented and draws them to learn more, not by intrigue, but rather the sheer beauty of the large scale photographs being presented. The paintings and objects come from all corners of art and design and are at times awe-inspiring, beautiful, intriguing, powerful, and even practical. Most of the viewership will not be prospective buyers as the percentage of the population that can afford such artworks is very small, so the presentation looks more to highlight and increase awareness of the works to generate excitement for them, which will in turn lead to a higher profile for the works.
					</p>
					<p> There is a calendar for viewing auctions, with links the to right to add the events to a personalized calendar. This has the aim of allowing the user to obtain the information quickly and remind themselves when to return. Again, as the portion of the audience that is more likely to spend a fair amount of time on the site is journalists or people involved in the art market who will be following the events, this is probably the most important function of the site, and something that it accomplishes quite successfully. One does not feel that they must spend a lot of time on the site to get this information. After spending some time on the site the user leaves satisified having hopefully obtained the information that they sought. 
					</p>

					<h1>
					<a href = "http://www.alexanderwang.com" target = "_blank">	Alexander Wang </a>
					</h1>
					<p>
					Simple, eye-catching, intriguing, bright, and humorous, the opening page of Alexander Wang's web store presents the user with a humorous repeating gif of a show with gum on the heel. Like beginning a speech with a joke, it disarms the user and opens them to a further presentation of what is being offered. As a famous, but not mass-produced designer, this highlights the individuality of Alexander Wang's vision and gives the impression that what will be presented is something unique, distinguishing itself from other offerings. This is essential to the business model, as the user will pay a premium for the products in the absence of mass-production.
					</p>
					<p> The clothing being presented is stylish, modern, fashionable, youthful, and at times even whimsical. Like most good sites that sell clothing, it is quite easy to rapidly navigate between different categories of clothing. The main navigational menu is ever present as a header and is always available to navigate away to something completely different. This way after spending some time on the site, the user is not tired from spending a great deal of time navigating.
					</p>
					<p> While I like Wang's style, I cannot say that I have ever purchased anything from his site. He has excellent ideas for outfits, but his clothes are rather overpriced and have a very homemade feel that gives the impression that one could find the individual pieces in his outfits from other sources and achieve a similar style.
					</p>
					<h1> <a href = "http://www.paddle8.com" title = "Paddle 8" target = "_blank"> Paddle8 </a> </h1>
					<p>	
					An art auction website that would invite comparisons to ebay had one never visited the site, Paddle8 presents the user with a beautiful and fluid presentation of available artworks while presenting it with the dignity and air that an organization auction art for thousands of dollars would deserve. The main focus of the site is the artwork that it is presenting with links presented immediately to the audience. The price and number of bids is displayed underneath each artwork and clicking one of the pictures takes the user to the auction page for that particular piece of artwork. The site acts as a medium for artists to display and sell their work. The site contains an easy explanation of how to become a buyer. From the outward appearance it looks like a great deal of effort goes into controlling the quality of artworks presented.
					</p>
					<p>
					Navigating through the site over time the user gains an appreciation for the artworks being presented and gets the feeling that they are looking at something that could be a valuable investment. The site's background is a blank white like Wang's, giving a minimalist look the attempts to feature the artwork on sale more prominently. Personally I have not purchased anything from the site yet, but get the impression should I be looking to purchase artwork for my home or office that it would be one of the first places that I looked.
