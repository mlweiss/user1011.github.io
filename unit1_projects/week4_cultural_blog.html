					<h2> Conflict Resolution </h2>
					<p>
						My general resolution to conflict is to try and discuss the roots of the conflict and see where each party was wrong. This generally does not have the desired effect. I can recall specific emotional conflicts with loved ones where this was not a desired behavior. Rather than go into too much detail, when there is a conflict and the other person feels hurt or unhappy with my behavior, I generally try to identify what that behavior was and determine if I was wrong. Almost invariably I determine that I was wrong and apologize for that aspect of my behavior and try to provide the reason why it occured and why it will not occur again. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This does not always have the desired effect of resolving the conflict however. When taking this route, the opposite party might still feel hurt or unhappy with the situation. Reflecting on my method of conflict resolution I would say that it is most similar to the "attack self" on the Compass of Shame. I suspect in most cases a direct appology is sufficient and then possibly a withdrawal to allow the other party to relax from the possible insult that resulted from my behavior. As more ideas come to my head I might elaborate more on my thoughts on this topic.
