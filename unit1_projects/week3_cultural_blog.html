						<h2> Learning Styles and DBC phase 0 </h2>
						<p>
						The Gregorc Mind Styles model was developed in 1984 out of previous work by Anthony F. Gregorc, a phenomenological researcher. On his website he explains the definition of the term phenomenological. Pheno means appearance or showing, noumena an object to which a phenomenon is being referred, and logos which is the root or cause of things. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, “Phenomenology studies conscious experience as experienced from the subjective or first person point of view.” Based on a test consisting of 15 questions based on my perceptions of myself, the conclusion was made that I am a strong abstract sequential learner.  This means that my preferred method of learning is seeing subjects presented in a logical order with an abstract presentation. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
						I had not actually thought about this preference before starting DBC, but reflecting on my most successful academic experiences, they often came when I was able to start reading about a subject from the beginning and build a foundation of knowledge that expands upon itself. For instance I found working through a math textbook by starting from the beginning chapter and working through all the exercise up to the end would be the best way to score well on a final exam (often even if the course material diverged a bit, well within reason). It was through these methods that I felt I gained the best conceptual understanding of a topic, as this way there were no gaps in my knowledge. I am not sure how one could approach mathematics in an abstract random or concrete random way as it is a very cumulative subject.
						</p>

						<p>
						Luckily programming is not the same. In fact I think one of the advantages is that for many purposes one can learn programming by simply looking up the methods that will be useful to the task at hand. The issue I find with that is that a lot of these methods are not retained if one does not take steps to take note of the new things learned from google searches or looking something up. It is much like how the process of learning a new language requires writing down and memorizing the words that one looks up in the dictionary.
						</p>

						<p>
						The phase 0 DBC curriculum has been challenging from the perspective that it is constructed to benefit those who prefer a random structure for learning. This actually strikes me as a little bit surprising, given that these resources are widely available without joining the DBC program. So what does DBC actually do aside from provide a base of links for these websites? Maybe I am not appreciating the hidden sequential structure that these exercises are being presented in. In any case, I think that I will still need to look for more thorough presentations of some of the topics presented in phase 0 to really solidify my conceptual understanding. This way I am not just looking things up as I need them, which would defeat the purpose of undertaking this process in the first place.
