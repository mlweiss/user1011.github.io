						When I think of times that I have been happiest in my life, proudest or most satisfied, the following values generally come to my mind:
						<ol>
							<li> Accomplishment </li>
							<li> Adventure </li>
							<li> Confidence </li>
							<li> Competence </li>
							<li> Creativity </li>	
							<li> Effectiveness </li>
							<li> Efficiency </li>
							<li> Health </li>
							<li> Knowledge </li>
							<li> Meaningful Work </li>
							<li> Physical Challenge </li>
							<li> Responsibility </li>
							<li> Self-Respect </li>
						</ol>
						Of these particular values I have found that competence and confidence in one's work have generally been the most important. In the past few years the work has gotten more and more challenging and the times when I was most successful were when I positioned myself to have enough time and energy to accomplish the work. It seems like all of the other aspects of my life followed suit when these main, fundamental desires were satisfied (that is, when I felt like I was successfully accomplishing what I set out to do I felt most happy). 
					</p>
				<p> The degree to which I live up to these values has changed somewhat over the years but I like to think that to a certain extent they have always been more or less with me.
					<ol>
							<li> Accomplishment 5 </li>
							<li> Adventure 4 </li>
							<li> Confidence 4</li>
							<li> Competence 4</li>
							<li> Creativity 3</li>	
							<li> Effectiveness 4</li>
							<li> Efficiency 3</li>
							<li> Health 5</li>
							<li> Knowledge 5</li>
							<li> Meaningful Work 5</li>
							<li> Physical Challenge 4</li>
							<li> Responsibility 3</li>
							<li> Self-Respect 4</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

					I am often asked advice about nutrition and fitness. They are topics that I care about and have tried to find systematic and fact based answers to. To a certain degree I have been successful and thus am open to giving advice about these topics when asked.
